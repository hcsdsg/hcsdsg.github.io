<h4> What is design goal behind ELDA? </h4>
<p>
Our goal is not to recreate any services, no need to reinvent the wheel. But to provide a straightforward way to deploy best-of-breed open-source systems for data analytics to diverse infrastructures and use cases. Any use case where you have data and data driven mindset, you should be able to use ELDA. But our primary focus is log-analysis. Users will get all the tools and technology to handle log data, but you are free to leverage ELDA for any use case.
